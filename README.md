# Magento Chatbot Module (Telegram, Messenger, Whatsapp, WeChat and Skype)

**Chatbots!** They're all the rage: Telegram has them, Facebook wants them, and it seems like every computer coder wants to make them. But what are they? And why is every company suddenly hot on this new A.I. trend?

> Chatbots are computer programs that you interact with via a chat interface. Using a chatbot is as simple as having a conversation with it. You can ask it questions or give it commands, and it'll respond to you and carry out your actions. Chatbots can be run in any number of chat apps, including Facebook Messenger, your phone's text messaging app, and most others.

**Become part of the chatbots revolution.**
**Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/blopa/Magento-Chatbot/releases/latest).**

## IMPORTANT
We're currently refactoring all our codebase and database structure, so we renamed the `Magento1` folder to `Magento1_deprecated`, the new Magento1 module should be ready before January/2018. To access the deprecated Magento1 version click [here](https://github.com/blopa/Magento-Chatbot/tree/master/Magento1_deprecated)

Please notice that this first version is still not stable, but it should be in December/2017.

## About
This repository is the source code for the Magento Chatbot (Telegram, Messenger, Whatsapp, WeChat and Skype), with this module you can fully integrate your Magento store with the most popular chat apps in the market. This means that by simply installing this module and a few clicks you can have a new way to show and sell your products to your clients.
Very easy to use! Try now, it's FREE.

To use this module you'll need to have SSL enabled in your store, this is a requirement from Facebook and Telegram, not by me.

**For now only Facebook Messenger is implemented.**
